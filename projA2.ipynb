    "\n",
    "In Project A1, you performed some basic Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), laying out the thought process that leads to certain modeling decisions. Then, you added a few new features to the dataset and cleaned the data in the process.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will specify and fit a linear model to a few features of the housing data to predict house prices. Next, we will analyze the error of the model and brainstorm ways to improve the model's performance. Finally, we'll delve deeper into the implications of predictive modeling within the Cook County Assessor's Office (CCAO) case study, especially because statistical modeling is how the CCAO valuates properties. Given the history of racial discrimination in housing policy and property taxation in Cook County, consider the impacts of your modeling results as you work through this project, and think about what fairness might mean to property owners in Cook County.\n",
    "\n",
    "After this part of the project, you should be comfortable with:\n",
    "- Implementing a data processing pipeline using `pandas`.\n",
    "- Using `scikit-learn` to build and fit linear models.\n",

    "\n",
    "In Project A1, you wrote a few functions that added features to the dataset. Instead of calling them manually one by one each time, it is best practice to encapsulate all of this feature engineering into one \"pipeline\" function. Defining and using a pipeline reduces all the feature engineering to just one function call and ensures that the same transformations are applied to all data.  Below, we combined some functions into a single helper function that outputs `X` and `Y` for the first model above. Try to understand what this function does! \n",
    "\n",
    "**Note 1:** We have automatically imported staff implementations of the functions you wrote in Project A1. These functions are `remove_outliers`, `add_total_bedrooms`, `find_expensive_neighborhoods`, `add_in_expensive_neighborhood`, and `ohe_roof_material`. You are welcome to copy over your own implementations if you would like.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note 2:** The staff implementation provided for `remove_outliers` is slightly different from what you did in Project A1. Here `remove_outliers` is exclusive for the bounds whereas in Project A1, it was inclusive for the bounds. `remove_outliers` will only output values strictly greater than the lower bound and strictly smaller than the upper bound. Feel free to still use your original implementation of the function; it shouldn't affect your score if it was done correctly but may slightly change your approach to `q5f`."

    "- **If you are running into memory issues, restart the kernel and only run the cells you need to.** The cell below (question cell) contains most to all of the imports necessary to successfully complete this portion of the project, so it can be completed independently code-wise from the remainder of the project, and you do not need to rerun the cell at the top of this notebook. The autograder will have more than 4GB of memory, so you will not lose credit as long as your solution to Question 5 is within the total memory (4GB) limits of Datahub. By default, we reset the memory and clear all variables using `%reset -f`. If you want to delete specific variables, you may also use `del` in place of `%reset -f%`. For example, the following code will free up memory from data used for older models: `del training_val_data, test_data, train, validation, X_train_m1, X_valid_m1, X_train_m2, X_valid_m1`. Our staff solution can be run independently from all other questions, so we encourage you to do the same to make debugging easier.\n",
    "- **If you need the data again after deleting the variables or resetting, you must reload them again from earlier in the notebook.**\n",
    "- You will be predicting `Log Sale Price` on the data stored in `cook_county_contest_test.csv`. We will delog/exponentiate your prediction on Gradescope to compute RMSE and use this to score your model. Before submitting to Gradescope, make sure that your predicted values can all be delogged (i.e., if one of your `Log Sale Price` predictions is 60, it is too large; $e^{60}$ is too big!)\n",
    "- You MUST remove any additional new cells you add before submitting to Gradescope to avoid any autograder errors. \n",
    "- **You can only submit your test set prediction CSV file to Gradescope up to 4 times per day. Start early!** In the case that you are approved for an extension, you will be granted 4 more submissions for each day the deadline has been extended.\n",

Do not edit the two lines at the end of the question cell below. They are helper functions that define a linear model, fit your data, and compute RMSE. If you do, you will receive no credit for this question.** \n",

You will be predicting `Log Sale Price` on the data stored in `cook_county_contest_test.csv`. To determine your model's RMSE on the test set, you will submit the predictions made by your model to Gradescope. There, we will run checks to see what your test RMSE is by considering (hidden) true values for the `Sale Price`. We will delog/exponentiate your prediction on Gradescope to compute RMSE and use this to score your model. Before submitting to Gradescope, make sure that your predicted values can all be delogged (i.e., if one of your `Log Sale Price` predictions is 60, it is too large; $e^{60}$ is too big!)\n",

This might look like somone whose home is worth 120,000 being valued at 200,000 by the CCAO, leading to a residual of -80,000. In this case they owe (-1) * (-80,000) * (the tax rate) more in dollars.

    "\n",
    "In the case of the Cook County Assessor’s Office, Chief Data Officer Rob Ross states that fair property tax rates are contingent on whether property values are assessed accurately —— that they’re valued at what they’re worth, relative to properties with similar characteristics. This implies that having a more accurate model results in fairer assessments. The goal of the property assessment process for the CCAO, then, is to be as accurate as possible. \n",
    "\n",
    "When the use of algorithms and statistical modeling has real-world consequences, we often refer to the idea of fairness as a measurement of how socially responsible our work is. Fairness is incredibly multifaceted: Is a fair model one that minimizes loss - one that generates accurate results? Is it one that utilizes \"unbiased\" data? Or is fairness a broader goal that takes historical contexts into account?\n",
    "\n",
    "These approaches to fairness are not mutually exclusive. If we look beyond error functions and technical measures of accuracy, we'd not only consider _individual_ cases of fairness but also what fairness —— and justice —— means to marginalized communities on a broader scale. We'd ask: What does it mean when homes in predominantly Black and Hispanic communities in Cook County are consistently overvalued, resulting in proportionally higher property taxes? When the white neighborhoods in Cook County are consistently undervalued, resulting in proportionally lower property taxes? \n",
    "\n",
    "Having \"accurate\" predictions doesn't necessarily address larger historical trends and inequities, and fairness in property assessments in taxes works beyond the CCAO's valuation model. Disassociating accurate predictions from a fair system is vital to approaching justice at multiple levels. Take Evanston, IL —— a suburb in Cook County —— as an example of housing equity beyond just improving a property valuation model: their City Council members [recently approved reparations for African American residents](https://www.usnews.com/news/health-news/articles/2021-03-23/chicago-suburb-approves-government-reparations-for-black-residents).\n"

    "In a perfect world, the model used by the assesors office would be acurate in terms of rmse AND have its errors equally distributed over the range of home prices. I think of our model as our measurment instrument, so I don't think that the modeling stage is the best place to implement equity. I'd hope that we can generate an instrument which is accurate and is free from systematic error over its range of inputs. Then once we have a reliable instrument at our disposal, we could implement a progressive tax system at the policy level by explicitly designing the property tax rate to increase with either home value, net household income, or some other metric of financial security.</br>\n",
    "</br>\n",
    "In the real world, however, where we might be stuck with a flat property tax rate, then the implemataion changes aimed at creating equity of can unfortunately only come from the design of our instrument. In that case, special attention needs to be paid to the accuracy of predictions for which errors will cause the greatest harm to those who they effect. In this case, that means minimizing the residuals--specifically the negative residuals--for homes whose value is low, as it is likely that the increase in property tax liability caused by these errors will place a greater burden on those homeowners than a similar error would to a homeowner whose property was worth more. This may come at the expense of increased error at the higer range of home prices. Within reason, this is acceptable."
